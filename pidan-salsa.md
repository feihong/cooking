## Ingredients

I've doubled the amounts of all ingredients from the source.

- 1 cucumber
- 2 tomatoes
- 2 green chilis
- 1 lime
- 4 stalks cilantro
- 1/2 onion (maybe)
- 6 pidan
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- salt + pepper

Note: Remember to take out the seeds of the cucumbers, tomatoes, and chilis.

Note: Try adding a little sesame oil in place of some of the olive oil.
