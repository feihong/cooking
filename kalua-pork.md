## Ingredients

- 4 lb bone-in pork shoulder roast, cut into 2 pieces
- 6 garlic cloves
- 1 cabbage, cored, cut into wedges
- 1 Tbsp liquid smoke
- 1 Tbsp kosher salt

## Notes

Use Â¾ teaspoon of medium-coarse salt for every 1 pound of meat. Don't use too much salt because the pressure cooker concentrates flavors.

You can use red cabbage instead of the usual green. Cabbage only needs to be cooked for 3 minutes under high pressure, but I prefer 5 in my pressure cooker. It might be a good idea to trim the base of the stems, as those tend to be have a rougher texture even after being pressure-cooked.

Don't trim the fat -- instead, cut slits in it and make sure the fat is on top when you place the meat inside the cooker. After the pork is cooked, you can remove the fat. I didn't perceive any obvious benefit to leaving the fat in while the cabbage cooked in the pork juice.
