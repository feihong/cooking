## Ingredients

- 4 lb bone-in pork shoulder roast, cut into 2 pieces
- 6 garlic cloves
- 1 cabbage, cored, cut into wedges
- 1 Tbsp liquid smoke
- 1 Tbsp kosher salt

Note: Use Â¾ teaspoon of medium-coarse salt for every 1 pound of meat. Don't use too much salt because the pressure cooker concentrates flavors.

Note: You can use red cabbage instead of the usual green. Cabbage only needs to be cooked for 3 minutes under high pressure, but I prefer 5 in my pressure cooker.

Note: Don't take the fat out, but make sure the fat is on top.
